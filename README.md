# Music Database Database - School Project

This project showcases a collaborative effort completed during my coursework at NSCC, where I had the opportunity to delve into backend development. Under the guidance of my instructor, who built the front-end and I took on the challenge of developing the back-end. This endeavor resulted in a sophisticated Node.js and Express application designed to operate as a REST API for a comprehensive music database.

Leveraging the efficiency of SQLite through the better-sqlite3 library, our application offers a seamless data storage solution. It features designated endpoints that allow for access to a wide array of musical data, including artists, albums, tracks, media types, and themes.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in backend development but also provided a practical experience in collaborative software development, emphasizing the importance of integrating frontend and backend components to create a cohesive and functional application.


## Tech Stack

JavaScript, HTML, Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, Rest APIs


## Features

-Retrieve all media types and themes.

-Express server with structured routing.

-SQLite database integration for efficient data retrieval.

-Middleware for logging and request parsing.


# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Node.js (Download and install from Node.js website)

A package manager (npm is included with Node.js)

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
```
Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd path-to-your-project
```
Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Start the application
```bash
node app
```

This will start the server on port 3000. If you wish to use a different port, you can modify the app.listen call in the server's main file.
